This repository is for some basic introduction to Python scripting

# Getting Started
Some basic examples are available in the GettingStarted folder.  These will
cover the most simple examples of Python and allow you to get familiar with
running scripts.

## Invoking Scripts
Scripts can be executed by calling the python interpreter with the script
path as an argument. If the script includes a proper header with the
correct path to the python binary and has been chmod to be executable
(chmod +x) then the script can be invoked directly with ./[ScriptName]

### Finding Python Path
If you're not sure where python is on your system - you can find the path
to the binary by running:
> which python

## HelloWorld.py
Exclusively for a Hello World print out

### Invoking
> python HelloWorld.py
> ./HelloWorld.py
